## Project: Predicting_House_SalePrice

The aim of the project is to develop a machine learning model to predict house sale prices using features that describe various aspects of a house.

### Goals
- To be able to understand the features that affect the price of houses in the Market.
- To determine the significant features on which the house price depend on.
- To develop a model that predicts the price of a house using the selected/important factors.
